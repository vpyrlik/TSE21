#Time Series **vs** Random Sample

.pull-left[**Rnadom sample**: $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$

![](stuff/iid04.png)

- from different objects
- unordered
- *i.i.d.*]

--

.pull-right[**Time Series**: $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^T$

![](stuff/ts11.png)

- from the same object
- ordered in time
- doesn't have to be *i.i.d.*]
