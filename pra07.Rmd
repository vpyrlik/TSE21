###Constructing tests for RS or S&ETS cases

##Problem 1. MLR for RS (I)

Consider the traditional regresison model with only two factors:

$$y_i=\beta_o+\beta_1x_{i1}+\beta_2x_{i2}+\varepsilon_i,$$

under the assumptions:

.rb[A1] **Random Sampling**: .bb[?]

.rb[A2] **Exogenous Error**: .bb[?]

--

.rb[A3] **Exact ID**: $\mathbb{E}(x_i'x_i)$ has full rank.
.right[.rmk[.bb[?] What's the meaning of .rb[A3]?]]

##Problem 1. MLR for RS (II)

For this regression model, answer the following questions:

.bb[?] **Derive** the OLSEs of the regression coefficients.

--

.bb[?] **Derive** the difference $\hat\beta-\beta$ and show that the estimates are unbaised, consistent, and find their asymptotic distribution.
.right[.rmk[.rb[!] point out where and which theorems and assumptions are required]]

##Problem 1. MLR for RS (II)

Consider yet another assumption:

.rb[A4] $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2|x_i)=\sigma^2\in(0,\infty)\backslash\{\infty\}$.

</br>

.bb[?] Name the assumption. How does it relate to .rb[A1]?

--

.bb[?] Under .rb[A4], how does the $V_\beta$ change?

.bb[?] What's a "good" estimate of $V_\beta$ then?

--

.bb[?] What should be the estimate for $V_\beta$ without .rb[A4]?

---
class: animated, fadeIn

##Problem 1. MLR for RS (III)

Disregard .rb[A4]. Say, you got $\hat V_\beta$, a consistent estimate of $V_\beta$.

</br>

.bb[?] Construct a test for $H_o=\beta_1=0\}$. Explain how it works.

.bb[?] How's it gonna be different if $H_o=\{\beta_1=2\}$?

--

.bb[?] Construct a test for $H_o=\{\beta_1=\beta_2\}$.

--

.bb[?] Construct a test for $H_o=\{\beta_1=0,\;\beta_2=0\}$.

--

</br>

.bb[?] Explain, why it is important that $\hat V_\beta$ is consistent for $V_\beta$.

##Problem 2. MLR for S&ETS (I)

Instead of the model for RS from Problem 1, consider the same type of model with stationary and ergodic TS:

$$y_t=\beta_o+\beta_1x_{t1}+\beta_2x_{t2}+\varepsilon_{t}.$$

.bb[?] Change the assumptions appropriately.
.right[.rmk[.bb[?]Explain why each particular assumption does change or doesn't change]]

--

.bb[?] How does the derivation of OLSEs change?

.bb[?] How does their properties change?
.right[.rmk[.bb[?]Point out which theorems and assumptions are reuqired.]]

--

.bb[?] How does the part with the tests change?

---
class: animated, fadeIn

##Problem 2. MLR for S&ETS (II)

.bb[?] Write down in detail the asymptotic variance of the OLSEs.

--

.bb[?] What's an appropriate way to estimate $V_\beta$?

.bb[?] Say, $T=40$. Write down the NW-HAC estimator for $V_\beta$.
